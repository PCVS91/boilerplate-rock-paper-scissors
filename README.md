# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the boilerplate for the Rock Paper Scissors project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors

I worked only on the RPS.py file, all others came prewritten. 
The player analizes patterns in the opponent behaviour to adapt the model and make predictions. 
Might improve speed if I use batches instead of training after each game.

First ML project I have done
